Hi there! I'm Peyton. Right now, I work at [Modal Labs](https://modal.com/) building various bits of infrastructure.

I like building systems, and I love talking about systems. I love cooking, but I'm pretty sure that's just another system. Some of my past projects:

- The CockroachDB Cloud [Fine Grained Access Control](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/authorization) system
- [CIS 188](https://cis188.org/), a course that taught students modern deployment methodologies
- [SPIRE TPM Plugin](https://github.com/bloomberg/spire-tpm-plugin), a set of plugins to allow [SPIRE](https://github.com/spiffe/spire) to do TPM 2-based node attestation
- [Proxmox K3s](https://github.com/pawalt/proxmox-k3s), a set of automation allowing for zero-touch deployment of K3s on Proxmox
- [Caplance](https://github.com/pawalt/caplance), a network-level load balancer in the spirit of Maglev
- [GoPunch](https://github.com/pawalt/gopunch), a p2p chat server using UDP hole punching
- [Penn Labs' Infrastructure](https://github.com/pennlabs/infrastructure/), a repository to fully control a [Penn Labs'](https://pennlabs.org/) infrastructure as code
