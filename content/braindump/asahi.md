The [Asahi project](https://asahilinux.org/about/)  is a set of projects & people focused on building out support for ARM Mac devices in the Linux kernel.

Asahi can technically work with any distro, but the "officially supported" (insane levels of air quotes here) is the [Fedora Asahi remix](https://asahilinux.org/fedora/). I ran this for a while and had a really excellent experience. It was the smoothest out-of-the-box Linux experience I've ever had. Low bar there, but we'll take what we can get.

Asahi can work with NixOS, and I've had a pretty good experience running this setup. There are some [prebuilt NixOS modules](https://github.com/tpwrules/nixos-apple-silicon) to make this easier.

[The Asahi subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsahiLinux/) is a good place to go for more info and support.
