The world of programming content is a shitshow. From [courses](https://www.algoexpert.io/product) promising to get you jobs to [influencers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmONbYqYaRk) preaching the glory of FAANG, it's so hard to find anything worth paying attention to.

The hard part here is that I think it's super important to stay up to date on things! It's probably a good idea to keep track of the LLM space, but it's so hard to avoid the flood of [grifters](https://twitter.com/itsPaulAi). Somehow I've managed to avoid getting sucked into these pits, but I've never been sure why.

It took way too long to come to this realization, but for me, it's all about the people I'm around. My friends are the most talent-dense group of people I've met in my life, and I learn so much just by being around them. Whatever online gurus can offer, you can get 1000x that just by being around people who love the game just as much as you do.

For me, this usually just means seeing what lands in the group chat every day. Whether it's the [corporate drama of the day](https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/17/23965982/openai-ceo-sam-altman-fired) or someone going [way too deep](https://github.com/davish/website-astro/blob/a3874dd2770507f4256630a2dff798b88f9208af/flake.nix) on their website's build system, I wake up every day looking forward to learning something new.

And all they've taught me doesn't hold a candle to how they've been there for me ❤️
