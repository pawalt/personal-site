I came across one of my favorite quotes ever sampled in a song, and I had to share it here.

> If you're starting to trying to be a musician or artist—something like that—because you wanna make money, because you wanna do a job, that's- that's the wrong way. You have to do this because you love it. And it doesn't matter if you broke, you still gon' do it. I mean, I go out to jam sessions, and I play regardless of whether I'm getting a check or not. It's-, it's about whether I, uh—you have to love this thing, man! You have to love it and breathe it and—It's your morning coffee. It's your food. That's why you become an artist.
