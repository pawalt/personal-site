My friend told me that you can [request a download](https://www.spotify.com/us/account/privacy/) of all your listening activity from Spotify! I got Claude to basically one-shot creating an artifact to do this. You can view it [right here](/artifacts/listening/activity.html)! I've also got an <a href=/artifacts/listening/dummy-spotify-data.json download>example file</a> you can download while you wait for your data to come back.

Big thanks to [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/) for [giving me the inspiration](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/21/claude-artifacts/) to make this simple visualizer.
